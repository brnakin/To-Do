## Features

- **Action Detection**: The app uses natural language processing to identify actions within your input text. For example, if you write "Buy groceries," it will recognize "Buy" as the action.

- **Deadline Extraction**: When you provide a deadline in your task description, such as "Finish report by Friday," the app extracts the deadline date and time, allowing you to set due dates easily.

- **Smart Advice**: In addition to recognizing actions and deadlines, the app offers helpful advice based on the context of your tasks. For instance, if you have multiple tasks due on the same day, it might suggest prioritizing them.
